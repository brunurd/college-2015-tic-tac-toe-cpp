# Tic Tac Toe - C++

I'm currently rewriting the code of this repository (a college project made in 2015 using **[Borland BGI](http://www.codecutter.net/tools/winbgim/)**) to test my skills and study C++.

## How to compile (Windows only)

### MinGW (cmake, make, gcc)

You can generate a project runing cmake in the root folder, I build using CLion with a MinGW i686/32-bit stack. It don't work with Visual C++ because the bgi static lib is not a `.lib` file.
