# Tic Tac Toe - C++

I'm currently rewriting the code of this repository (a college project made in 2015 using **[Borland BGI](http://www.codecutter.net/tools/winbgim/)**) to test my skills and study C++.

## How to compile (Windows only)

### MinGW (cmake, make, gcc)

You can generate a project runing cmake in the root folder, I build using CLion with a MinGW toolchain (I use version 4.6.2 32-bit [download here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingwbuilds/files/host-windows/releases/4.6.2/32-bit/threads-win32/dwarf/x32-4.6.2-release-win32-dwarf-rev0.7z/download)). It don't work with Visual C++ because the bgi static lib is not a `.lib` file.
